# How to run the app:

### You can open this link: https://antliann.github.io/covid19/ with an already deployed app, however GitHub pages are not ideal in their work.


## To run the project on your PC:

If Node.js is not installed on your PC, download it from
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
\
\
Run this commands in the project directory:
#### 1) `npm i react-scripts`
#### 2) `npm start` or `yarn start`
An app should automatically open in your browser.\
If no, manually enter `localhost:3000/covid19` in your address bar.
\
\
P.S. If `yarn` is not installed on your PC, run `npm install --global yarn`.
